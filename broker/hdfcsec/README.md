# HDFC Securities (InvestRight API) plugin

Full REST trading port. Replaces the 2026-05-20 scaffolding.

## What's implemented

| Surface | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Auth (OAuth-style daily click) | ✅ | Customer pastes Consumer Key + Consumer Secret once; InvestRight's `?request_token=` callback captures the daily access_token at `/broker/hdfcsec/callback`. |
| Place order (CNC / MIS / NRML / MTF — NSE/BSE/NFO/BFO/CDS/MCX) | ✅ | F&O orders auto-multiply by lot_size from the master contract. F&O contracts pass `underlying_symbol` + `expiry_date` (DDMMYYYY) + `strike_price` + `option_type` as separate fields per InvestRight's spec. |
| Smart order (position-size targeting) | ✅ | Per-symbol lock + 1s position cache, same shape as the icicidirect / definedge plugins. |
| Modify / cancel / cancel-all | ✅ | Cancel is a PUT to `/orders/{id}` with no body. |
| Order book / trade book / order status | ✅ | InvestRight wraps row arrays under `data`; single-order details under `data[0]`. |
| Positions / holdings | ✅ | Positions live under `data.net[]`; we normalize "ALL" exchange to NSE. Holdings derive exchange from the first 3 chars of `instrument_token`. |
| Funds / margin | ✅ | `data.equity.totalAvailableLimitDetails.cash` → availablecash; utilised + collateral surfaced separately. |
| Master contract (NSE/BSE/NFO/BFO/CDS/MCX) | ✅ | Daily download of the security-master CSV from `/oapi/v1/security-master`. F&O rows pack underlying + expiry + strike + right into the OpenAlgo packed symbol. |
| Quotes / depth / historical OHLCV | ⚠️ Stubbed | InvestRight REST does not expose live quotes or OHLCV. Returns 0-filled quote with a `note`. Use a different broker for tick-driven strategies. |
| WS live ticks (NOWStream) | ⚠️ Stubbed | Different host + binary protocol from InvestRight. Tracked as a follow-up; adapter loads cleanly and reports a clear error on `connect`. |
| TOTP seed storage | ✅ | Field exposed in broker_metadata; stored encrypted for future automated daily login. |

## Customer setup

1. Sign in at https://developer.hdfcsec.com → **Apps** → create or
   open an app and copy the **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret**.
   Configure the redirect URL to `<host>/broker/hdfcsec/callback`.
2. Paste **Consumer Key** as the API Key and **Consumer Secret** as the
   API Secret in AlphaGo's Manage Brokers screen.
3. (Optional) Save your HDFC Securities mobile app's **TOTP Seed** to
   the same form — stored encrypted for future automated daily login.
4. Click **Connect HDFC Securities** — you'll be redirected to the
   InvestRight login page; after 2FA, InvestRight posts
   `?request_token=<token>` back to AlphaGo, which exchanges it for an
   `accessToken` and stores the auth-string (`access_token:::api_key:::api_secret`).

## IPv6 status — IPv4-ONLY, NOT reachable from hostingsol egress

⚠️ The previous scaffold claimed AAAA via AWS ALB CNAME. **That was wrong.**
Re-verified 2026-05-25 from multiple resolvers:

```
$ dig developer.hdfcsec.com AAAA +short
hsl-aws-aps1-alb-prod-370976271.ap-south-1.elb.amazonaws.com.   (CNAME only)
$ dig developer.hdfcsec.com A +short
13.127.107.37
13.126.100.11
```

The CNAME target is an IPv4-only AWS ALB. Since hostingsol's per-customer
egress is a GRE /128 IPv6 tunnel, customer containers physically cannot
reach this host. The InvestRight REST port code in this directory is
correct and works on any dual-stack network — but `hdfcsec` is
**deliberately excluded** from hostingsol's `SUPPORTED_BROKERS` until
either:

- HDFC enables dual-stack on the ALB (out of our control), OR
- hostingsol gets per-customer IPv4 routing infra (tracked in
  `hostingsol/docs/B5_HAPROXY_PROGRESS.md` — multi-week project).

The exclusion is documented in code: see
`hostingsol/provisioner/provision.py` around `SUPPORTED_BROKERS`.

## Known follow-ups

- **NOWStream WebSocket port** — InvestRight's real-time tick feed
  runs on a separate host with a binary protocol; the OpenAlgo adapter
  stub is in place so dispatch loads cleanly.
- **Quotes / OHLCV via a different broker's feed** — strategies that
  need real-time ticks should subscribe via Zerodha / Upstox / Dhan
  while routing orders through HDFC.
- **Programmatic TOTP daily autologin** — uses the stored `totp_seed`.
  Same shape as the planned ICICI Direct autologin path.
